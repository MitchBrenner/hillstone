# Hillstone 🍸

**Hillstone** is a small experimental web app built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [GSAP](https://gsap.com/) to explore creative animation techniques for modern web development.

## 🚀 Purpose

This project was created **specifically to experiment with GSAP animations** in a Next.js environment. The primary goal was to:

- Learn how to integrate GSAP and its plugins (e.g. ScrollTrigger, SplitText) with Next.js
- Explore scroll-driven animations
- Experiment with creative layout transitions and motion design

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Next.js** – React framework for building modern web apps
- **GSAP** – Powerful JavaScript animation library
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first styling
- **React Responsive** – Media queries in React
- **TypeScript** – Static typing (if used in your project)

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

> **Note:** This project was **focused entirely on animation experiments** rather than production-ready design. As a result:
>
> - Layouts are **not fully responsive** across all screen sizes
> - Some animations may behave inconsistently on small screens or mobile devices
> - It’s not optimized for accessibility or performance for real-world use
>
> This was purely a playground to push the limits of animation techniques.
